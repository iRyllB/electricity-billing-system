# Electricity Billing System

A simple Python-based application to calculate electricity bills based on customer usage. This project demonstrates basic Python programming skills, including class structures and input handling.

## Why are we using CUI instead of GUI?
- The main goal of this project is to focus on the core functionality of the electricity billing system, such as customer management, bill calculation, and payment handling. A CUI (Command-line User Interface) was chosen to keep things simple and avoid unnecessary complexity. Adding a GUI would require more time and effort to implement features that are not directly related to the core functionality

## Features
- Allows users to create an account and login.
- Calculates the bill based on a rate per kilowatt-hour (kWh).
- Outputs a detailed billing statement with customer name, units consumed, and total cost.
- Users are able to export their billing history through a csv file.
- Generates a reciept after the payment.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
